How to get YaST2 screen shots from a test system
================================================

From April 2000 on, you can simply hit the <PrtScr> key. 

You will get PNG image files /tmp/scr00001.png, /tmp/scr00002.png
etc. - each invocation of the Qt UI will begin counting from 1. Any
existing screen shots will be overwritten without warning - i.e. move
them away and/or give them some more explanative name
(e.g. ~/yast2-screens/inst_lang.png).


If for any reason this should not work, there is still the old way:

 1. Add the xhost program to suse/inst-sys/usr/X11R6/bin. You'll need a
    special version that doesn't need all the dynamic libs the default one
    uses; ~snwint/Export/xhost.semistatic does the trick. (Don't forget to
    rename it to xhost.)

 2. Boot the test system and add the 'mem=46m' kernel option (at the 'boot:'
    prompt, enter 'linux mem=46m'). This way YaST2 ist started from
    suse/inst-sys (otherwise it starts from suse/images/yast2).

 3. When YaST2 is running, go to console 2 and enter the command
    'DISPLAY=:0 /usr/X11/bin/xhost +'.

 4. From some other system, get a screenshot by running
    'xgrabsc -d <host_where_YaST2_runs>:0 -root -ppm -o screenshot.ppm'.
